# UFOs


# Overview of Project:

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Deliverables 

**Deliverable 1:**  Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

**Deliverable 2:**  A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)



# Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

- Upon arrivale to the webpage you will be greated with this.

**This is the page that will allow you to do some searches.**

- The next step would be to use the filters along the left side of the page.

**These inputs can be used to search for specific information with the sections available.**

- Once that is done. The example provided below is using the "state" input and searched "ca" for California.

**All the results taking place in California will be searched.**

- The results of the previous step will be presented as follows.

**As it can be seen all the results involving California are listed.**

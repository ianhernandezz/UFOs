# UFOs


# Overview of Project

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Deliverables 

**Deliverable 1:**  Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

**Deliverable 2:**  A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)



# Results

**As it can be seen all the results involving California are listed.**



# Summary

As this webpage was coming together, I would indicate that one drawback to this webpage is the visual simplicity to it. It may need some polish before real life use.

**Two recoomendations would be;**

1. I would make the lines of that divide the different sections of this webpage a little bit more smooth.
2. I would use a different colors to be easier on the eyes
